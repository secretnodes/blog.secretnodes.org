The logo, created through collaboration with Johnny Theophilus, represents Secretnodes’ ability to hide sensitive data within a Trusted Execution Environment. Reminiscent of the Eye of Providence, the logo hints at keeping a watch over private keys as it features a pupil in the shape of a key.  ”Want to build a better internet?
